In this file is a homework page that has login,a homepage and a start up calander. 
This is manly a design elements for the page. the rest of the files are pictures.
in the futre i hop that i will get then linked together and make more interactive obtects. This is an end goal for the site.

I originaly wanted a teacher student homework page, but teachers would make it slower for responses. if they forget it is still your falut so just sutdent make it more reliable and it would be divided by class.
